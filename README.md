# No Tension

This is the app for managing client's bills and other stuff. Uses
cordova + ionic.

## Quick start with browser development

If you don't need to test native plugins and only implementing
features unrelated directly to iOS or Android, you don't need native
iOS and Android frameworks. You'll be developing with a browser
instead which provides much nicer development experience.

You simply install npm and bower dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

And you can start the local server with:

```sh
npm start
```

The server starts on port `9000`.
